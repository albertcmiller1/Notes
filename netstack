DHCP is a network management protocol used on IP at the application layer 


NAT 
> network access translation 
> technique 
> takes an IP and translate it to another 
> allows a gateway (usually a router or filewall) to rewrite the source IP of an outgoing IP datagram while retaining the original IP in order to rewrite it into the response 
> hides the IP from computer 1 from computer 2 (routers hold the info) 

routers have an interface .. this is how the computers in the network know to reach it 
A network switch is a computer networking device which connects various devices together on a single computer network.
Routers are computer networking devices that serve two primary functions: (1) create and maintain a local area network and (2) manage the data entering and leaving the network as well as data moving inside of the network.


proxy service | a server that acts on behalf of a client in order to access another service 
> anonymity 
> security 
> content filtering 
> increased performance 


reverse proxy | a service that might appear to be a single server to external clients, but actually represents many servers living behind it 





Ingress traffic can be any form of traffic whose source lies in an external network and whose destination resides inside the host network 

Egress traffic is all traffic directed towards an external network and originated from inside the host network

when you upload data to the internet its going out of your local network so the traffic is egress based on the LAN's perspective, but not the router. 
the router will treat that data as ingress since the traffic is coming towards it.
